# intro-to-CS
In the next Repo you can find about 14 projects I made for intro to CS written in C due to Nov.2020 - Mar.2021

## Road Map
**I divided the codes into 3 main sections:**

1️⃣ Assignments to submit\
2️⃣ Old exams\
3️⃣ Course final exam

## SKILLS
**Among the various capabilities you will find**

✅ Usage of int, double, float, long, char and strings
✅ Loops such as For, While, Do-While, Switch-Case
✅ Data storing in arrays, mat and similars 
✅ Usage of different Functions, Recursions, Structures, Pointers, Memory Allocation


### Summary
Long story short, the work state of mind is to use the Main.c file for Testing the other c files functions,
and to use header.h file to include libraries, declare functions and define vars value.

Hope you find this projects helpful! ⏳

🎮 Enjoy 💻
